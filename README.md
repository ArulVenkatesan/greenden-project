# greenden-project
Greenden is a fully responsive multi-page website built using HTML and TailwindCSS. It includes three main pages — Homepage, Product, and Contact — each designed with a clean and modern UI.
Through this project, I learned how to integrate and customize TailwindCSS, work with utility-first styling, and structure a responsive layout for different screen sizes. This project also helped me understand component-based design, responsive grids, and optimizing CSS workflow using Tailwind’s utility classes.
